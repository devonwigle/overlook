# Overlook Hotel

For this project, I wrote a hotel management tool for hotel customers make and view room bookings and calculate customer bills.

## Goals and Objectives
 * Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
 * Work with an API to send and receive data
 * Solidify the code review process
 * Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## How to look at my code on your local
 * `git clone [url] [new directory name]`
 * In your terminal cd into directory
 * `npm install`
 * `npm test`
 * `git remote add upstream [clone url]`
 * `npm start` in your terminal. 

 * clone this repo into a different directory https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api
 * cd into the directory
 * `npm install`
 * `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:8080/ to view the project

## Instructions for Use

use a username of "customer50" and a password of "overlook2021" to login

After logging in you will see the user name in the top right corner. The amount they have spent on bookings just beneath that.
The white box contains a horizontal scroll of the user's past, present, and future bookings.  Below the bookings display is the search component.  Select a date, or date and room type, click search.  The available bookings will populate below.

Once your search results have populated you can either search again or choose to book a room.  Click the book it button, and your booking will populate in the booking scroll at the far right end.  You can now continue searching and booking more rooms.

If your search doesn't have any available bookings, you will see the hotel apologizing for the lack of rooms available.

## Possible Future Features
 * Add a manager who would be able to see all customers bookings as well as delete bookings.
 * Images
 * Sorting the bookings display by past, present, and future.
